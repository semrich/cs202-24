Scott J Emrich; University of Tennessee - Knoxville

Note these files and notes are a mix from a former class of this instructor taught at the University of Notre Dame, a current version of the same course taught by Dr. Plank as recently as Spring 2023, and new notes/assignments developed by the instructor at UTK. As a result, not all of these files are guaranteed to be the same as any one previous iteration of this course.
